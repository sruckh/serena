### Fixed Docker Network Configuration Issue |TASK:TASK-2025-07-23-003|
- **What**: Fixed Docker Compose network configuration to use existing shared_net instead of creating isolated serena_shared_net network
- **Why**: Container was isolated on its own network and couldn't communicate with other containers in the ecosystem
- **How**: 
  - Updated compose.yaml to use external shared_net network instead of creating a new one
  - Added project name to compose file for consistent naming
  - Changed network configuration to use `external: true` for shared_net
- **Issues**: Network connectivity issues preventing inter-container communication
- **Result**: Container now connects to shared_net network and can communicate with other services

### Fixed Docker Network Isolation Issue |TASK:TASK-2025-07-23-002|
- **What**: Fixed network isolation issue where Serena container was creating its own network instead of joining the existing shared_net network
- **Why**: Container was isolated on serena_shared_net network and couldn't communicate with other containers in the ecosystem
- **How**: 
  - Updated compose.yaml to use external shared_net network instead of creating a new one
  - Added project name to compose file for consistent naming
  - Changed network configuration to use `external: true` for shared_net
- **Issues**: Network connectivity issues preventing inter-container communication
- **Result**: Container now connects to shared_net network and can communicate with other services

### Fixed Docker Container Exit Issue |TASK:TASK-2025-07-23-001|
- **What**: Fixed issue where Serena Docker container would start but immediately exit
- **Why**: Container was not staying running due to incorrect stdio transport configuration and missing stdin_open/tty settings
- **How**: 
  - Updated compose.yaml to properly configure stdio transport mode
  - Added stdin_open and tty settings to keep container running
  - Corrected command to use proper working directory path
  - Removed unnecessary port and host flags for stdio mode
- **Issues**: Container was exiting immediately after MCP server initialization
- **Result**: Container now stays running and waits for MCP client connection via stdio transport

### Added Volume Mounts for Common Directories
- **What**: Added volume mounts for /opt/docker and /mnt/backblaze directories to Docker Compose configuration
- **Why**: Provide Serena with access to common project locations and storage directories
- **How**: 
  - Added volume mounts to both serena and serena-dev services
  - Updated DOCKER.md documentation to reflect the new volume configuration
  - Configured automatic mounting of /opt/docker and /mnt/backblaze directories
- **Issues**: None - backward compatible changes
- **Result**: Serena can now access files in /opt/docker and /mnt/backblaze directories from within the container

### Docker Network Security Improvements
- **What**: Updated Docker Compose configuration to remove port exposure to localhost and configure services to communicate on internal Docker network only
- **Why**: Enhance security by preventing direct access from host machine and ensuring services communicate only through the internal Docker network
- **How**: 
  - Removed `ports` directives from both serena and serena-dev services
  - Added `expose` directives to make ports available within Docker network
  - Configured both services to use `shared_net` network
  - Removed unnecessary `--transport sse` flag from production service
  - Updated documentation to reflect network configuration changes
- **Issues**: None - backward compatible changes that improve security
- **Result**: Services now communicate securely on internal Docker network without exposing ports to localhost

### Documentation Framework Implementation |TASK:TASK-2025-01-23-001|
- **What**: Implemented comprehensive CLAUDE.md modular documentation system following Conductor v1.1.2 guidelines
- **Why**: Establish baseline repository with excellent AI navigation and code maintainability for the Serena coding assistant project
- **How**: Created modular documentation system with cross-linking, conducted security review, and performed static code analysis
- **Issues**: None - clean implementation with well-structured existing codebase
- **Result**: 6 documentation files created (CLAUDE.md, ERRORS.md, TASKS.md, CONFIG.md, API.md, DESIGN.md) with full cross-referencing, comprehensive security assessment completed, code quality validated

### Security Health Check Completed
- **What**: Comprehensive security analysis of Serena codebase
- **Why**: Establish security baseline and identify potential vulnerabilities before repository publication
- **How**: Static analysis of Python code, dependency review, configuration audit, Docker security check
- **Issues**: Found 2 high-severity and 4 medium-severity issues, all non-critical
- **Result**: Overall security rating "GOOD" - no critical vulnerabilities, solid security practices demonstrated

### Code Quality Assessment 
- **What**: Static code analysis for syntax errors, bugs, and improvement opportunities
- **Why**: Validate code quality before establishing as baseline repository
- **How**: Pattern matching for common issues, import analysis, exception handling review, async/await validation
- **Issues**: Found bare except clauses, star imports, 25+ TODO comments - all minor quality issues
- **Result**: Codebase demonstrates good engineering practices with proper file handling and async patterns
